# A-Neural-Image-Caption-Generator
A Neural Image Caption Generator using CNN and LSTM

Abstract
Automatically describing the content of an image is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence that connects computer vision and natural language processing. In this project, we implement the idea of the paper “Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator” . We use inceptionV3 as pre-trained CNN to extract features from images and LSTM as RNN to generate image descriptions.
